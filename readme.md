# Text Preprocessing for NLP

**Text preprocessing** is the foundational step of cleaning and preparing raw text data for machine learning. It is a critical factor in the performance of NLP applications.

### ✨ Why It Matters
- **🚀 Performance:** Directly impacts the speed and accuracy of your NLP models.
- **🧹 Clean Data:** Transforms messy, real-world text into a structured format.
- **🎯 Better Results:** Essential for effective chatbots, search engines, and sentiment analysis tools.

### 🎯 Key Impact
- Improves model performance and accuracy.
- Prepares data for applications like chatbots, search engines, and sentiment analysis.

## Importance of Text Preprocessing

Raw text data is often noisy and unstructured. Preprocessing cleans this data to improve model performance by addressing inconsistencies like typos, slang, and irrelevant information.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Improves Data Quality:** Removes noise for cleaner, more consistent data.
- 🚀 **Enhances Model Performance:** Enables better feature extraction for more accurate models.
- ⚡ **Reduces Complexity:** Simplifies text, increasing model efficiency and lowering computational costs.


## Text Preprocessing Techniques

This toolkit implements standard NLP preprocessing techniques to transform raw text into a clean, analyzable format.

- **🔍 Regular Expressions (Regex)**  
  Powerful pattern matching for finding and replacing text based on custom rules (e.g., emails, punctuation).

- **✂️ Tokenization**  
  Splits a large text into smaller units like individual words or sentences for further analysis.

- **🌿 Lemmatization & Stemming**  
  Reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" → "run") to normalize text.

- **📝 Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
  Labels each word with its grammatical role (e.g., noun, verb) which is crucial for understanding sentence structure.




## Example Usage
A corpus is just a big body of text that computers use to learn how human language works.
Here's a practical example of applying text preprocessing techniques to a sample corpus:

```python
corpus = [
    "Hello, there I am am a student from metropolia university of applied science",
    "I study computer science and I love to build stuff",
    "I love coding and my favourite languages are C,C++ and python, I also love building embedded devices"
]

Here's that text cleaning section formatted for a GitHub README.md:

## 1. Text Cleaning

This step converts text to lowercase and removes punctuation, numbers, special characters, and HTML tags.
